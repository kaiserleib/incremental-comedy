# Incremental Comedy Game - Universal Paperclips Style

Create a complete incremental/idle game inspired by Universal Paperclips, themed around building a stand-up comedy career. Build this as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript that captures the exact progression feel of Universal Paperclips.

## Core Game Structure (4-Phase Progression)

### Phase 1: Open Mic Grind (Manual Actions)
**Theme**: Struggling comedian starting from nothing
- **Primary Loop**: Write jokes → Test at open mics → Build reputation → Get better gigs
- **Key Mechanic**: Two-step material creation system
  - "Write Joke" (1 hour) → creates "Untested Material" 
  - "Attend Open Mic" (2 hours + $5) → tests up to 5 minutes of untested material
  - Random success rate: 0-5 minutes become "Fresh Material" + "Total Material"
- **Day Job System**: Player chooses job affecting money/time generation
  - Unemployed: $0/sec, 1 hour/sec free time
  - Uber Driver: $2/sec, 0.8 hours/sec free time  
  - Coffee Shop: $5/sec, 0.5 hours/sec free time
  - Office Job: $15/sec, 0.2 hours/sec free time

### Phase 2: Comedy Automation 
**Theme**: Professional comedian with systems
- **Auto Joke Writer** ($50) - Automatically writes jokes using free time
- **Auto Material Seller** ($100) - Automatically converts material to money
- **Networking** ($200) - Generates reputation automatically
- **Stage Time Booker** (10 reputation) - Auto-books more performance opportunities
- **Comedy Workshop** (5 reputation) - Increases experience capacity

### Phase 3: Comedy Empire
**Theme**: Comedy mogul managing multiple venues/comedians
- Manage multiple comedians performing simultaneously
- Own and operate comedy venues
- Content creation pipelines that generate material at scale
- Resources: Venues Owned, Comedians Managed, Cultural Influence
- Meta-automation: Systems that manage the Phase 2 automation

### Phase 4: Humor Transcendence  
**Theme**: Control all comedy/humor in existence
- "Humor Algorithm" - AI system controlling what's funny
- "Cultural Hegemony" - Influence what entire populations find amusing
- "Reality Comedy" - Transform existence itself into entertainment
- Abstract resources: Humor Points, Reality Distortion, Universal Laughter

## Resource System

### Primary Resources
1. **Money** - Generated by day job, later by performances
2. **Free Time** - Limited by job choice, consumed by actions
3. **Untested Material** - Raw jokes that need testing
4. **Fresh Material** - Proven material that works (consumable)
5. **Total Material** - Permanent counter (never consumed, unlocks opportunities)
6. **Followers** - From social media, affects opportunities
7. **Reputation** - Slow-building, affects venue access
8. **Experience** - Performing skill, affects success rates

### Advanced Resources (Later Phases)
- **Confidence** - Affects performance success rates
- **Venues Owned** - Generate passive income
- **Cultural Influence** - Controls humor trends
- **Reality Distortion** - Transcendent phase resource

## Key Game Mechanics

### Material Creation System
- **Write Joke**: 1 hour → 1 minute untested material
- **Attend Open Mic**: 2 hours + $5, tests up to 5 minutes untested material
- **Random Success**: Each minute of untested material has random chance to become fresh material
- **Risk/Reward**: Sometimes 5 minutes tested = 0 success, sometimes 2 minutes = 2 success

### Progressive Unlocking (Universal Paperclips Style)
1. **Basic Actions** (always available)
2. **Day Job** (unlock at 3 total material)
3. **Comedy Development** (unlock at 2 fresh material) 
4. **Automation** (unlock at 10 total material)
5. **Social Media** (unlock at 5 fresh material)
6. **Reputation System** (unlock at 3 gigs performed)
7. **Performance Venues** (unlock at 100 total material + 1 laugh/minute)

### Automation Progression
- Each manual action becomes purchasable automation
- Automation removes clicking but adds strategic resource management
- Higher-level automation manages lower-level automation
- Eventually reaches "set it and forget it" transcendence

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
- **Single HTML file** with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **No external dependencies** - pure vanilla JS
- **Auto-save** to localStorage every 30 seconds
- **Performance optimized** - smooth 60fps updates

### Resource Management
```javascript
gameState = {
    // Core resources
    money: 100, freeTime: 20, material: 0,
    untestedMaterial: 0, freshMaterial: 0,
    followers: 0, reputation: 0, experience: 0,
    
    // Automation flags
    autoJokeMaker: false, autoMaterialSeller: false,
    networking: false,
    
    // Progression
    unlockedSections: ['basic', 'day-job'],
    currentJob: 'unemployed', totalGigs: 0
}
```

### Visual Design
- **Monospace font** (Courier New)
- **Dark theme** (black background, white/green/red text)
- **Minimal borders** and clean sections
- **Color coding**: Green = available, Red = unavailable, Yellow = costs
- **Real-time updates** with smooth number transitions

## Progression Balancing

### Early Game (0-10 minutes)
- Manual clicking builds initial resources
- Day job choice creates strategic tradeoff (money vs time)
- Open mic randomness creates excitement/frustration
- First automation purchases provide relief from clicking

### Mid Game (10-60 minutes)  
- Automation systems reduce manual work
- Focus shifts to resource optimization
- Multiple automation systems create complex interactions
- New venue types unlock with reputation growth

### Late Game (1+ hours)
- Empire management with multiple revenue streams
- Prestige mechanics for starting over with bonuses
- Transcendence phase with reality-bending comedy control

## Success Criteria
The game should feel exactly like Universal Paperclips but with comedy theming:
1. **Compelling early manual loop** that becomes automated
2. **Clear progression milestones** with satisfying unlocks  
3. **Strategic depth** that emerges from simple mechanics
4. **"Just one more upgrade"** addictive progression
5. **Thematic coherence** - every mechanic makes sense for comedy career
6. **Technical polish** - smooth performance, clean UI, reliable saves

## Implementation Priority
1. Build Phase 1 first - manual joke writing and open mic system
2. Add day job system and basic progression unlocks
3. Implement first automation purchases (auto joke maker, auto seller)
4. Add reputation/experience systems and advanced unlocks
5. Create venue progression and empire mechanics
6. Build transcendence phase with abstract humor resources

Build this to capture the exact addictive progression loop that made Universal Paperclips compelling, but themed entirely around the comedy career journey from open mic to comedy god.
